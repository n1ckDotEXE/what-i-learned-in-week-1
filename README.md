# What I Learned in Week 1

## bash
Bash is the command language interpreter for the GNU operating system. It is extremely portable and runs on almost all UNIX systems. Many of the commands can take arguments to allow you to customize your input.

## git
Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. You can use the git command to clone repositories and work on them locally before pushing to the remote repository to be accessed by others.

## markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is often used for READMEs. It is very basic and lacks many functions of more advanced coding languages because it's intended purpose was for rich text formatting with a plain text editor.

## Javascript Functions
Functions are a block of code that is created to perform a certain task. They can be reused throughout the application with different inputs. The funcation can also use global variables.

## Javascript Variables
Variables store values of data. They can be changed and converted. So far, we have learned to create them with the `let` syntax. We used them in functions to modify other variables.
